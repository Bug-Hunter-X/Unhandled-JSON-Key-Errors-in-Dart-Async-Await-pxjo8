# Unhandled JSON Key Errors in Dart Async/Await

This example demonstrates a common error when handling asynchronous operations and JSON decoding in Dart. The code fetches data from an API, parses the JSON response, and processes the data. However, it lacks robust error handling for situations where expected keys are missing from the JSON objects.  This leads to runtime exceptions and provides only generic error messages.

The solution shows how to improve the error handling to provide more specific and informative error messages, handling cases where the JSON structure differs from expectations.
